I am a researcher at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) working in the area of Decentralized Identity and Blockchains Security. Currently, designing a privacy preserving decentralized identity system using verifiable credentials and blockchains. Apart from academic activities, I love jogging, biking and playing badminton. In my free time, I also mentor undergraduate students for them to participate in CTF security contests, contributing to open source softwares and grad school applications.
